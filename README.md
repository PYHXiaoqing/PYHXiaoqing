**你好, 我是PengYuhan, 社交平台的昵称通常是Xiaoqing。男, 目前15岁, 定居于中国浙江宁波。一名初中牲, Minecraft玩家, 编程爱好者😀...**

我是一名初中生，就读于宁波的一所普通初中。成绩还行🤭，英语、社会（历史、地理和道德与法治）最好, 语文较差😐...。最喜欢英语课和信息课。我希望能考上鄞州中学（比较好的）。加油吧...

我是名Minecraft玩家， 大概玩了六七年。从冈易基岩版到冈易Java版再到国际版，我始终热爱着Minecraft。爱好建筑、红石和起床战争。生是方块人， 死是方块魂！也是因为Minecraft我才逐渐对编程产生兴趣。

我是名编程爱好者。目前正在学习Python和前端。没有我想不到的， 只有我写不出来的...

祝我学业有成=w=

## Welcome to my homepage!

**Hello, I am PengYuhan, and my nickname on social platforms is usually Xiaoqing. Male, currently 15 years old, settled in Ningbo, Zhejiang, China. A junior high school student, Minecraft player, programming enthusiast😀...**

I am a junior high school student, studying in an ordinary junior high school in Ningbo. My grades are okay🤭, English and social studies (history, geography and morality and rule of law) are the best, and Chinese is relatively poor😐... I like English and information classes the most. I hope to be admitted to Yinzhou Middle School (which is relatively good). Come on...

I am a Minecraft player, and I have played it for about six or seven years. From the bedrock version to the Java version to the international version, I have always loved Minecraft. I like architecture, redstone and bed wars. I am a block man in life and a block soul in death! It is also because of Minecraft that I gradually became interested in programming.

I am a programming enthusiast. I am currently learning Python and front-end. There is nothing I can't think of, only what I can't write...

I wish me academic success =w=
